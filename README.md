# Predicting Mortgage Rates From Government Data
This page showcases the knowledge and skills I've acquired during the Microsoft Professional Program for Data Science. It presents a solution of a real-world data science problem that took the form of a challenge in which I had to explore a dataset and develop a machine learning solution that was tested and scored against other competitors.

The dataset consists of 21 variables, such as demographics, location, property type, lender, etc., that are to be used for the prediction of mortgage rate spreads across the United States. I trained a CatboostRegressor model on 20.000 mortgage loan applications and concluded that the lender, loan amount, property type, loan type and applicant income have the most significant impact on the mortgage loan rate spread.

Currently the project is still live.<br/>
Current rank (Paradjs): 47/690.<br/>
